# Business-Analysis

Used excel to analyze data from the cannabis company Stiizzy. I calculated the amount of total sold products from a certain store in California "JV".
Another calculation I did was the average price of a certain type of product that each store sells. Lastly, I took the average of a certain product at a 
certain store. Adding to my calculations, I also inserted a pivot table that broked the data down by city and inside of that city every category of each
product is shown.
